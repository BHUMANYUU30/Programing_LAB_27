## 📌 Project Overview  

This project demonstrates the implementation of branching, merging, and structured workflow management concepts within a machine learning environment using Kaggle.

The experiment simulates software development practices such as independent feature development and controlled integration using modular notebook design.

## 📊 Dataset Used  

USA Housing Dataset  

The dataset contains the following features:

- Average Area Income  
- Average Area House Age  
- Average Area Number of Rooms  
- Average Area Number of Bedrooms  
- Area Population  

### Objective  
To predict housing prices using regression models.

## ⚙️ Implementation Workflow  

The workflow was structured into the following stages:

### 1️⃣ Base Setup  
- Dataset loading  
- Data inspection  
- Missing value verification  

### 2️⃣ Preprocessing Stage  
- Removal of non-essential columns  
- Feature-target separation  
- Train-test split  
- Feature scaling  

### 3️⃣ Model Development  

Two regression models were developed independently to simulate branching:

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  

### 4️⃣ Merging Stage  

- Performance metrics (MAE, MSE, R²) were compared  
- Best-performing model was selected  
- Final workflow integrated  

---

## 📈 Results  

| Model | R² Score |
|--------|----------|
| Linear Regression | ~0.92 |
| Random Forest | ~0.89 |

Linear Regression demonstrated slightly better performance on the dataset.

## 🔄 Workflow Concept  

Although Kaggle does not support native Git branching, the experiment simulates branching and merging using:

- Modular notebook sections  
- Version checkpoints ("Save Version")  
- Comparative model evaluation  

This approach reflects structured development practices used in collaborative machine learning projects.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used  

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Kaggle Notebook Environment
